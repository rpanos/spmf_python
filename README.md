Support tools on Python for SPMF

The following python package contains tools that will enable a developer to utilize [SPMF](http://www.philippe-fournier-viger.com/spmf/) at a greater scale calling the JAav based tool using python.

Many of these tools are inspired by the years I was able to leverage this great open source tool to conduct thousands of pattern mining studies during my PhD dissertation at ASU.  This is very much an ongoing effort and suggestions on future features would be trmendously appreciated.
